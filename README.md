# Trucking_System
FinalProject
This is the updated Dashboard schema. The admin dashboard is complete, we just need to make the customer and driver dashboards now.
Admin Dashboard:
System Management: Full control over all modules and user accounts.
Truck Management: Oversee truck inventory and assignments.
Cargo: both shipment and bookings have been combined with cargo, so Bookings from customers should go here, this also has the price estimation which will need to be returned to customer
Reports: Delivery report.

Truck Driver Dashboard:
Truck Management: Add, update, and delete truck details (e.g., registration, capacity, type), assign trucks to drivers, and manage truck availability.
Shipment Tracking: Update and track the status of shipments (In Transit, Delivered).
Notifications: Receive alerts for maintenance and license expiration.
Profile Management: Edit personal details, including contact information.

Customer Dashboard:
Booking Management: Book shipments (including pickup/delivery locations and goods type) and view/manage booking history.
Price Estimation: Automatically calculate costs based on distance and weight.
Shipment Tracking: Track the current status of shipments.
Payments: Make payments and view transaction history. (lets make this simple, just make this a choice when its unpaid there is an option to "pay" and when you click it, it asks "are you sure" then afterwrads if they respond yes, it is paid.)
Profile Management: Edit personal details such as address and contact info.
